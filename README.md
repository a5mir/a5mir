**AF Calculator**

App developed to help me at my current job. I usually get several offers, whit different charges and in different currencies, which I have to calculate and choose the best offer. Also it helps me to calculate chargable weight of cargo ((WxLxHcm)/6000). 
The app is written in Dart and Flutter. 
_Tested only on several Android phones/never tried it on iOS device._
